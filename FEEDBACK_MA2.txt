 * Ok report results, but where are the truncation error analysis?
   Also some of the analytical results regarding the damped and undamped 
   waves are missing.

 * The solver in general is looking good. Use more commenting and docstrings.

 * Tests are fine, but the more important tests are missing! Ok implementation
   of physical problem.

Try to finish everything before the exam, would be a smart move.

Approved.
