 * In general everything looks nice, better if you had wrapped all of it inside vertical_motion.py.
 * Ok, class based solution which.
 * You have almost no comments or docstrings. VERY important to use these, makes the code lucid and easier to read.
 * In vertical motion you have a main() function which you are calling everytime the program runs. This should be put
   into a if __name__ == '__main__': block instead.
 * Besides from that the code is good and clean, appropriate use of whitespaces and line shifts.
 * You still have some way to go when it comes to the tests. Some are missing, and some are not correct. Check it out, it will
   be important later.

Approved.
